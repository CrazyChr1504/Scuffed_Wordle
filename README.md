# Scuffed_Wordle
Final project for Programming 1.

## Description

This README is a visual presentation for what I have acomplished with my final project in Programming 1.
This program is a scuffed wordle game with colored prints that you play in the vscode terminal.
You get to pick the difficulty: 3, 4, or 5 letter words.

## Languages

- Python

## Requirements/Prerequisites

```
2. Install colorama

## Usage

```
for words in ui_list:
    counter = 0
    ic  = 0
    for letter in words:
        if letter in letter_list:
            if words.count(letter) > letter_list.count(letter):
                x = words.count(letter)
                counter += 1 
                if (counter + 2) == x:
                    if letter == letter_list[ic]:
                        print(Fore.GREEN, f"{letter.upper()}", end="")
                    else:
                        print(Fore.YELLOW, f"{letter.upper()}", end="")

                elif counter < x:
                    if letter == letter_list[ic]:
                        print(Fore.GREEN, f"{letter.upper()}", end="")
                    else:
                        print(Fore.YELLOW, f"{letter.upper()}", end="")

                elif counter == x:
                    print(Fore.WHITE, f"{letter.upper()}", end="")

                else:
                    print(Fore.WHITE, f"{letter.upper()}", end="")

            else: 
                if letter == letter_list[ic]:
                    print(Fore.GREEN, f"{letter.upper()}", end="")
                else:
                    print(Fore.YELLOW, f"{letter.upper()}", end="")

        else:
            print(Fore.WHITE, f"{letter.upper()}", end="")
        ic += 1
    print(Fore.RESET, "")
```
